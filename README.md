This project is a simple implementation of an Email Spam Classification System that categorizes emails as “Spam” or “Ham” (not spam). It uses NLP and machine learning techniques to preprocess text, extract features, and classify emails effectively.


#### Interaction:

2. Hit “Send” to classify the email as Spam or Ham.


#### Manage Emails:
